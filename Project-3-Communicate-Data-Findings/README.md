# The PISA Data

## By Senga Mukanda

## Dataset

The dataset that I chose to explore was the PISA 2012 assessment.
PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. This survey examines
* how well students have learned the school curriculum,
* how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

PISA is a unique global survey that examines how well prepared 15 year old students are for life after they have completed school. Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy.

## Summary of Findings

I want to take a look at what factors have an effect on the overall average scores in Maths, Reading, and Science of the students that participate in these tests.
There are indeed a lot of factors that would play a role in this, but I chose to only look at whether gender or birth year plays a role, if the country where the test is taken contributes as well, and I will also look at if the parents job status plays a role.

In doing so I concluded this:
* I learned that more females participated in the survey than males. Since the females performed better than the males when it came to Reading any country that had more female participants would have a better average in that. 
* The male participants performed better than the females when it came to Math and so any country that had more male participants would have a better average in that.
* They performed evenly equal when it came to Science, so the overall average depended on the number of factors such as gender participation when it came to that. This is because science is a mixture of both reading and maths so if you have more females the average favors them and vice-versa.

## Key Insights for Presentation

These are the main information I focused on for my presentation:
* 1. What is the average score that the students obtained for each each subject?
        * The first thing I want to look at is the students average score in the subjects that they wrote on.
* 2. Subject Averages Based on Gender
        * Next I just want to have a look at how both gender perform against each other in the subjects overall average score.
* 3. What is the correlation between the three subjects?
        * Lastly I want to see how each subject correlate to one another.

The reason why I chose to go with this is because during my exploration I found out that gender seems to play a big role than the other factors I chose to look at.

When I started with my exploration I was mainly interested in the factors that contributes to the total averages of **Math, Reading and Science**.
I was majorly interested on how the **Parents Work Status** would affect the score averages for the students, so to say in the least I was a bit dissapointed that I didn't get the outcome I was looking for.
Even though **Birth Year** was one of my factors of interest, I saw that I would need other factors which I did not include in my dataset. So this also turned out to not give me any promising outcome because there was not much information I could get from it.
The two factors that gave me the most results were **Gender and Country Code** suprisingly enough they were the two factors I thought would not contribute much to the overall averages. So my presention takes a sneak peak in that information.
